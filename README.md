This Project was for my Algorithms project 2. The goal of this project was to traverse a matrix and find the sum of the best path, with the best path being the path that gave the max sum of the matrix. This had to be done with a penalty system that tracked the previous 2 rows that were traveresed and would dynamically remember the values of previously traveled paths. 

input.txt is the file that you put the rows then columns of the matrix in the first row, then put the matrix in proper formatting in the bottom.

output.txt is the answer to the problem

Makefile is for compiling on linux

matrix.cpp is the source code that is used.
